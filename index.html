                <h2>Old Trafford</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Old Trafford is a football stadium in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, and the home of Manchester United. With a capacity of 74,310 it is the largest club football stadium and second-largest football stadium overall after Wembley Stadium in the United Kingdom, and the eleventh-largest in Europe. It is about 0.5 miles (800 m) from Old Trafford Cricket Ground and the adjacent tram stop.

Nicknamed "The Theatre of Dreams" by Bobby Charlton, Old Trafford has been United's home ground since 1910, although from 1941 to 1949 the club shared Maine Road with local rivals Manchester City as a result of Second World War bomb damage. Old Trafford underwent several expansions in the 1990s and 2000s, including the addition of extra tiers to the North, West and East Stands, almost returning the stadium to its original capacity of 80,000. Future expansion is likely to involve the addition of a second tier to the South Stand, which would raise the capacity to around 88,000. The stadium's record attendance was recorded in 1939, when 76,962 spectators watched the FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town.

Old Trafford has hosted an FA Cup Final, two final replays and was regularly used as a neutral venue for the competition's semi-finals. It has also hosted England fixtures, matches at the 1966 World Cup, Euro 96 and the 2012 Summer Olympics, including women's international football for the first time in its history, and the 2003 Champions League Final. Outside football, it has been the venue for rugby league's annual Super League Grand Final every year except 2020, and the final of Rugby League World Cups in 2000 and 2013.

                    <p>
                        Erik ten Hag was confirmed as Manchester United mens senior team manager in April 2022, replacing Ralf Rangnick after the 2021/22 Premier League campaign.

Ten Hag had a 13-year playing career, including three spells with Twente, where he retired in 2002.

After his playing career finished, he was appointed as manager of Go Ahead Eagles in 2012, leading the team to their first promotion in 17 years during his only season at the club.

He moved to Bayern Munich's reserve team in June 2013 and two years later, was appointed the sporting director and head coach of Utrecht, where he won the manager of the year award in 2016.

The 52-year-old took over as Ajax head coach midway through the 2017/18 campaign and would lead them to the UEFA Champions League semi-final the following season.

That year, Ten Hag also claimed his first trophies as a manager, winning the league and cup double.

In January 2022, he became the fastest manager to reach 100 league wins with Ajax, achieving the feat in just 128 matches.
