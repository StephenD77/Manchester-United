## Credits

## Content
- Many issues were at least partly resolved by searching [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- Harry, a CI mentor helped me as much as he good with some good advice and shared his knowledge when i got stuck.
- Some issues i was able to figure out with the help of the Slack Community.
## Acknowledgements

 This website was executed and completed as a portfolio 1 Project for the full stack diploma at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). I would like to firstly thank my mentor Harry Dhillon for his time and knowledge. I would like to thank my fellow students at Code Institute for assisting me when i ran into issues. Manchester United is a real concept, but the website is purely for the sake of the developer's portfolio and not for public consumption.
